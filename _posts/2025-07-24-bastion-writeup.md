> **Disclaimer:** The ***writeups*** that I do on the different machines that I try to vulnerate, cover all the actions that I perform, even those that could be considered wrong, I consider that they are an essential part of the **learning curve** to become a **good professional**. So it can become very extensive content, if you are looking for something more direct, you should look for another site, there are many and of higher quality and different resolutions, moreover, I advocate that it is part of learning to consult different sources, to obtain greater expertise.

I start another **[Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com){:target="_blank"}** lab and I did not expect the technologies that I would have to face, the research and reading time that it demanded from me **were extensive** as well as the search for the necessary tools to access different resources and leak information. The installation and configuration of tools trapped me, as I had to immerse myself in new concepts and challenges that I was able to overcome. The complexity of the machine was rated as **Easy**, but I honestly considered it as **Medium** due to my lack of knowledge of most of the concepts acquired. I signin with my **[Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com){:target="_blank"}** account to spawn the box and start my Writeup.

<br /><br />

Before starting my search for vulnerabilities or attack vectors, I have to check that I already have connectivity with the lab, for this I send a trace with `ping` and wait for the packets to be received by the target machine, then with `whichSystem.py`, a tool developed by the **[hack4u](https://hack4u.io/){:target="_blank"}** community, inform me of the **OS** installed on the machine (**Windows**), data that I deduce thanks to the **value** of the **TTL**. The next tool in my repertoire is `nmap`, with which I can start the **Reconnaissance** phase and know which ports are open, and thanks to the custom scripts of this tool (written in **LUA**) I can know the services and their versions (I already have an idea of the **OS version**). With `crackmapexec` I can leak information about the **SMB** protocol, such as that it is not signed and may be vulnerable to an **SMB Relay attack**, it also tells me the precise version of the OS and its architecture (64bits).

> **[SMB Relay Attack](https://www.vectra.ai/modern-attack/attack-techniques/smb-scanning){:target="_blank"}**: With this technique, attackers take advantage of the **SMB** protocol's built-in trust in network users. The attacker uses scanning to identify available accounts to target, then intercepts and manipulates a valid authentication session. By capturing and relaying authentication traffic, the attacker impersonates the user to gain unauthorized access.

> Hereâ€™s a common **SMB relay attack progression**: "man-in-the-middle" (techniques such as **ARP spoofing** or **DNS poisoning**).

```bash
ping -c 1 10.10.10.134
whichSystem.py 10.10.10.134

I start my research with the **RCP** protocol, and I try to connect without entering a password with `rpcclient` but this function is disabled (**good** restrictive policy). With `smbclient` I find a very suspicious shared resource, **Backups**, which I investigate further with `smbmap` to know what **permissions** I have on the available resources. I have **Read** and **Write** permissions, so with `smbclient` I can connect without a password, there is a lot of information, so I'd better set up a **CIFS** type mount, to access the resources from my file system and have a better experience navigating the different paths. Once I access I find two **.vhd** files corresponding to **[Virtual Hard Disks](https://www.techtarget.com/searchvirtualdesktop/definition/virtual-hard-disk-VHD){:target="_blank"}** that deserve to be analyzed more in depth.

> A **.vhd file** is a **Virtual Hard Disk** file format, essentially a file that acts like a physical hard drive within a **virtualized environment**. It's commonly used to store a virtual machine's **Operating System**, **applications**, and **data**, allowing users to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.

> A **[virtual hard disk](https://www.techtarget.com/searchvirtualdesktop/definition/virtual-hard-disk-VHD){:target="_blank"}** (**VHD**) is a disk image file format for storing the entire contents of a computer's hard drive. The **disk image**, sometimes called a **virtual machine** (**VM**), replicates an existing drive, including all data and structural elements. It can be stored in any location accessible to the physical host, and it is also transportable, meaning it can be stored and moved with a **USB flash memory device**.

```bash
rpcclient -U '' 10.10.10.134 -N
smbclient -L 10.10.10.134 -N

smbmap -H 10.10.10.134 -u 'null' --no-banner
smbclient //10.10.10.134/Backups -N
  dir
  ...

mkdir SMBBastionShares
mount -t cifs //10.10.10.134/Backups /mnt/SMBBastionShares
cd /mnt/SMBBastionShares/WindowsImageBackup/L4mpje-PC/Backup\ 2019-02-22\ 124351

With a little guidance from the community and a lot of research work, I manage to find the precise tool to **[manage .vhd files](https://www.diskinternals.com/vmfs-recovery/mount-vhdx-linux/){:target="_blank"}**, which is **[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/){:target="_blank"}**. Now I have to install the **qemu-utils** package on my machine, I also need **nbd-client** (to be able to **mount virtual disk images**) and I can start the **[mount configuration](https://gist.github.com/allenyllee/0a4c02952bf695470860b27369bbb60d){:target="_blank"}**. The first step is to use `rmmod` to load the **nbd kernel module**, `modprobe` allows me to define the maximum number of partitions that can be mounted by the image, I continue mounting the block device (I try with the first **.vhd** file I found) with `qemu-nbd`, finally I create the mount for the **nbd0p1** block and I can access the information of the first **Virtual Disk**. After a long time of browsing the file system I find nothing interesting.

> **[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/){:target="_blank"}** is a generic and open source **machine emulator** and **virtualizer**. When used as a machine emulator, **QEMU** can run **OSes** and **programs** made for one machine (e.g. an **ARM** board) on a different machine (e.g. your own PC). By using **dynamic translation**, it achieves very good performance. When used as a virtualizer, **QEMU** achieves near native performance by executing the guest code directly on the host CPU. **QEMU** supports virtualization when executing under the **Xen hypervisor** or using the **KVM kernel module** in **Linux**. When using **KVM**, **QEMU** can virtualize **x86**, **server** and **embedded PowerPC**, **64-bit POWER**, **S390**, **32-bit** and **64-bit ARM**, and **MIPS guests**.

> **Network Block Device** (**NBD**) kernel module: This module allows Linux to treat **VHD** and **VHDX** files as block devices, which can then be mounted as if they were **physical disks** (For `qemu-nbd` to work correctly).

```bash
apt update
apt install qemu-utils -y

sudo apt install nbd-client

rmmod nbd
modprobe nbd max_part=16

qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 /mnt/SMBBastionShares/WindowsImageBackup/L4mpje-PC/Backup\ 2019-02-22\ 124351/9b9cfbc3-369e-11e9-a17c-806e6f6e6963.vhd

mkdir ./BastionPC
mount /dev/nbd0p1 /mnt/BastionPC
cd ./BastionPC
```

I'm going to mount the other **.vhd** file I found, which has a larger size so I think it is the main one. With `modprobe` I reload the **nbd** module and with `qemu-nbd` I try to mount the **block device** (the second virtual hard disk) but this time `qemu-nbd` informs me that it can't set the new socket. I research on the **Internet** to find out what I'm doing wrong, and with a little patience I find that the error why **[`qemu-nbd` cannot set the NBD socket](https://realtechtalk.com/qemunbd_Failed_to_set_NBD_socket_solution_qemunbd_Disconnect_client_due_to_Failed_to_read_request_Unexpected_endoffile_before_all_bytes_were_read-2513-articles){:target="_blank"}** is because I did not disconnect the previous block device. Once I correct the error with `qemu-nbd` I can set up the second **.vhd** file and mount it. I make an exhaustive enumeration of the file system and the most interesting thing is that I have all the permissions on the folder **C:\Windows\System32\config**, which would allow me to **[dump the password hashes](https://www.elcomsoft.jp/help/en/edfb/obtaining_password_hashes-ppa.html){:target="_blank"}** of the system accounts (from **SAM** and **SYSTEM** files). To automate this task I resort to `samdump2`, and indeed I can dump the hashes that I'm going to store in a file for later with `john` to try to crack. The next step is to use `john` together with the dictionary **rockyou.txt**, plus tell the tool the format of the hash (**NT**), and in a matter of seconds I find the password of the **L4mpje** account.

> **qemu-nbd** error: qemu-nbd is not that smart, this is caused by **/dev/nbd0** being connected.

> **Registry files** (SAM, SYSTEM): Please note that with this feature, you cannot dump from **SAM** and **SYSTEM** files that are currently in use (located in the **WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\config** folder), because **they're locked** by the operating system. **You can**, however, **make copies** of these files by **booting into an alternative operating system** such as another Windows installation or; another way is to **attach the hard disk** where these files are located **as a secondary drive to another Windows workstation**.

> **[`samdump2`](https://www.kali.org/tools/samdump2/){:target="_blank"}**: This tool is designed to **dump Windows 2k/NT/XP password hashes** from a **SAM** file, using the **syskey bootkey** from the **system hive**. This package also provides the functionality of **bkhive**, which recovers the syskey bootkey from a Windows NT/2K/XP system hive. **Syskey** is a Windows feature that adds an additional encryption layer to the password hashes stored in the **SAM** database.

With the credential I have I try to connect using the **SSH** protocol and I succeed, so I have access to the system and in the **Desktop** directory of **l4mpje** I find the first flag. I do not have privileges that allow me to **Escalate Privileges** for the moment, I try to access the **config** folder (to try again the attack to the **Virtual Hard Disk**), but in this system I do not have the necessary permissions, nor can I access the system information with `systemInfo`. I must try harder to find the next attack vector.

ssh l4mpje@10.10.10.134

My task of enumerating the system continues and I'm already thinking about automating it, but before I get to this I find a very interesting data, the remote connection manager **mRemoteNG** is installed on the machine. The next step is to investigate the hidden folder **AppData** of the user **l4mpje**, where the applications usually save their **configuration files** and I find a folder containing an **XML** file where I find the password hash of the **Administrator** account encoded in **Base64**.

> **mRemoteNG** is a free, open-source, tabbed, multi-protocol, **remote connections manager** for **Windows**. It allows users to **manage various remote connections** like **RDP**, **SSH**, **VNC**, and more, all within a single, user-friendly interface. It's a popular tool for **system administrators** and **IT professionals** who need to manage multiple remote servers and devices.

```cmd
cd C:\Program Files (x86)
dir
# mRemoteNG

cd C:\Users\L4mpje\AppData\Roaming\mRemoteNG
dir /a
type confCons.xml  
```

I search in **Github** for a tool that allows me to decrypt the found password and I find one from **[haseebT](https://github.com/haseebT/mRemoteNG-Decrypt){:target="_blank"}**, `mRemoteNG-Decrypt`. I just download the tool (a **Python** script) on my machine and check that it works correctly, plus I need to know what information it needs and the **flags** I should use. I just need to use **-s** to tell it what the **encrypted password** is and I immediately get the same in clear text. I try to connect via **SSH** with the **Administrator** account and I can already access the content of the last flag, finally engaged machine. Before killing the box I perform a cleanup on my machine, since I made several configurations for the Mounts.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haseebT/mRemoteNG-Decrypt/refs/heads/master/mremoteng_decrypt.py

> How I enjoy learning with **[Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com){:target="_blank"}** labs, they are the best to polish skills, for those who are experienced users, and excellent for those of us who are just starting in this amazing world of **Information Security**. I had a great time installing and configuring the necessary tools for the **Engagement** of the machine, plus I was able to assimilate new concepts that I really did not know deeply. Now I can kill the box and look for my next challenge.
