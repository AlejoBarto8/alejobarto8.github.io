> **Disclaimer:** The ***writeups*** that I do on the different machines that I try to vulnerate, cover all the actions that I perform, even those that could be considered wrong, I consider that they are an essential part of the **learning curve** to become a **good professional**. So it can become very extensive content, if you are looking for something more direct, you should look for another site, there are many and of higher quality and different resolutions, moreover, I advocate that it is part of learning to consult different sources, to obtain greater expertise.
